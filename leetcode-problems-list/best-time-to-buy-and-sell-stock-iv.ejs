<p>Say you have an array for which the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> element is the price of a given stock on day <i>i</i>.</p> 
<p>Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most <b>k</b> transactions.</p> 
<p><b>Note:</b><br> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).</p>
